Branches in git
Display local branches
git branch

Display remote branches
git branch -r

Display local and remote branches
git branch -a

Create Branch and Work on it
Every new implementation/bugfix must be done in a separate branch

git branch example

  git branch task-1

Branch is usually created from current branch

Branches are light weight in git

Switching to task-1 branch

  git checkout task-1

Add few commits to task-1
Merging changes from your branch to main branch
Typically you cannot merge changes directly to main branch rather it has to be reviewed before you merge changes to main.

You have to push your local branch to remote git push origin task-1
Create pull request in Web UI
After getting approval for pull request merge it. and delete the branch
to delete branch git branch -d task-1
Force deleting a branch
Sometimes you complete a task and client say we do not need those changes in such scenarios we have to force delete branches

   git branch -D <branch-name>
   -D is for force delete
Delete branch in remote
First delete branch in local
Then run this command git push -d origin task-1
Resolving Conflicts (Interview Question)
Conflicts occur when multiple developers working on same file and same line.

Conflicts can be resolved manually or using tools (Ex: DiffMerge Tool)

Install diffmerge tool https://sourcegear.com/diffmerge/downloaded.php
Integrating diffmerge with Git place folllowing configurations in ($USER_HOME/.gitconfig)
[diff]
   tool = diffmerge
[difftool "diffmerge"]
   cmd = C:/Program\\ Files/SourceGear/Common/DiffMerge/sgdm.exe \"$LOCAL\" \"$REMOTE\"

[merge]
   tool = diffmerge
[mergetool "diffmerge"]
   keepBackup = false
   trustExitCode = true
   cmd = C:/Program\\ Files/SourceGear/Common/DiffMerge/sgdm.exe -merge -result=\"$MERGED\" \"$LOCAL\" \"$BASE\" \"$REMOTE\"

Opening diffmerge tool git mergetool
Git undoing changes
Discard changes in working area git checkout <file-name1> <file-name2>
Unstage file/files, takes changes form staging and puts it back to working area ``` git reset HEAD
Git Reset
   git reset a96e78c 
   Reset deletes all commits above mentioned commit   
   Use reset only for local commits not for remote commits
Different Modes of reset
Mixed reset git reset --mixed a96e78c Default is --mixed, it keeps changes in work area
Soft Reset (Interview Question) git reset --soft a96e78c keeps changes in index/staging area
Hard Reset (Interview Question) git reset --hard a96e78c Discards changes premanently
Git Revert (Undo Commit)
Git revert undoes changes in specific commit and makes new commit git revert commit-id
#git clone https://github.com/lokesheere/devops-we-aug-2019.git
cd devops-we-aug-2019
git status
git add info.txt
git status
git config --global user.email "lokesbeere1995@gmail.com"
git commit -m 'learing git'
git log
git push origin master 
git remote -v
git remote add hari   https://github.com/lokeshbeere/devops-we-aug-2019.git
git remote rename hari ravi
git remote remove ravi  
---- if u have modified code in git lets say and try to add the modified text file also then ?-----
initially fetch or pull from remote i.e origin

git fetch origin master
git merge -- conflict occurd bcoz those files are different-- then
git add *
git commit -m 'merging '
git push origin master
